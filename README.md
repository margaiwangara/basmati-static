The project contains three branches each with a different styling.

## Partitions

This project contains three branches

### Branch - Third-Concept

The project contains a single simple landing page with links to the welcome area, rice area, about us area and contact us area. It also has a footer with social links and navbar links to the right. The main color concept used is green. Since there is no backend, the contact us area still doesn't lead anywhere
